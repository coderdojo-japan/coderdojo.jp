## How to contribute

Fulfill the requirements, setup by following the instructions, and send a pull request for anything you want to contribute.

### Requirements

- [Ruby](http://ruby-lang.org/)
- [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/)
- [Scrivito](https://scrivito.com/) (Option)

### Setup 

1. Fork and clone this repository.
1. `$ bin/setup`
1. Access to [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

If you successfully set up, you can see the same page as [coderdojo.jp](http://coderdojo.jp).

### Scrivito

Some pages require [Scrivito](https://scrivito.com/), Professional Cloud-Based Rails CMS, such as:

- `/kata`
- `/docs/*`
- `/news/*`

CMS enables wider people to contribute to editing contents,   
but on the other hand, this requires Scrivito API Keys for    
engineers to join developing Scrivito-used pages like above.

If interested in developing them, contact [@yasulab](https://github.com/yasulab) to
get production keys (`SCRIVITO_TENANT` and `SCRIVITO_API_KEY`).
