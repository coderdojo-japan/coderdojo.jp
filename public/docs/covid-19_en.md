It matters to us that Code Clubs, CoderDojos, and Raspberry Jams are safe spaces for everyone involved. This note provides advice on coronavirus and what steps you could take to help keep everyone safe. 

For the latest information on coronavirus and how it affects you and your club or event, please check the website of your local public health organisation. These organisations regularly update their websites and are your most up-to-date source of information. We strongly encourage you to defer to the advice on these websites. 

You should also contact the venue where you host your club or event to discuss and agree what additional actions you could take to help keep everyone safe. 

If, having checked your local public health advice and consulted your venue, you feel that it is right to cancel a club session or other event, you should do so. You do not need to contact anyone at the Raspberry Pi Foundation before making that decision.

If you decide to go ahead with your club session or event, then you should consider taking the following actions:

1. Advise participants that they should not attend the club or event if they are feeling unwell.
2. Check your local public health organisation’s website for guidance on self-isolation if participants have for example travelled to an affected area or been in close contact with someone who has been diagnosed with coronavirus. Pass on that guidance to your participants.
3. Encourage all attendees to adopt good hygiene practices. The [World Health Organisation’s websiet](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/advice-for-public) is a good starting point for finding information and advice about this.
 
If a parent or carer asks you for advice about coronavirus, please refer them to their local public health organisation. We strongly advise you not to try to provide public health advice yourself.

If a young person feels unwell while in your care, please contact their parent/carer as usual. 

Please contact us if you have any questions, and remember to regularly check your local public health organisation’s website for coronavirus updates.

Thank you for everything you do to support the next generation of digital makers.
